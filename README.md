# Triumph – One Page Website Mockup

This project is a responsive, single-page website mockup built as part of an application for **Triumph**.
The goal was to demonstrate clean structure, modern UI patterns, and lightweight animations using core web technologies.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Semantic structure
* **CSS3** – Custom styling and animations (no animation libraries)
* **Bootstrap 5** – Grid system, utilities, and responsive layout
* **Swiper.js** – Touch-friendly carousel/slider

## Key Features

* Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Bootstrap grid and utility classes for spacing and alignment
* Custom CSS animations and hover effects
* Swiper.js carousel with swipe support
* Simple, readable code with minimal dependencies

## Notes

* Bootstrap is used where it makes sense; custom CSS handles animations and visual details
* No frameworks or heavy JS abstractions
* Focused on clarity, performance, and maintainability

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the project with any local static server.
